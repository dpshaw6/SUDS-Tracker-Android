				<P>T2 Mood Tracker is designed to help you track your emotional experience over time and to provide you with a tool to share this information with your health care provider.

				<P>This app comes with six pre-loaded issues: anxiety, depression, general well-being, head injury, post-traumatic stress, and stress. You can also add customized scales on any topic (e.g., a pain scale). You use simple sliders to rate yourself on these behavioral categories and the app automatically graphs your inputs. You can also make notes describing things that happened during the day that may have affected your moods. This provides you and your health care provider with a complete tool to help you uncover patterns in how you are feeling. It may also help you to evaluate the impact of daily events or the effects of treatment on your mood. 

				<P>T2 Mood Tracker was developed by the National Center for Telehealth & Technology (T2), the Defense Department’s primary agency for applying innovative technology to issues of psychological health and traumatic brain injury

        <item>The body is vulnerable to problems when it is not “maintained” properly.  Take timeout to relax or do enjoyable activities.</item>
        <item>Put effort into maintaining positive relationships at work.  After deployment you still need someone to watch your back. </item>
        <!-- <item>If you talk about your deployment at work, test the waters first.  You don\'t have to give all the details.</item> -->
        <item>Blowing off steam is a bad idea:   anger creates more anger, and stress creates more stress.  Solve the problem.</item>
        <item>Problems with drinking and drugs can be tough to work through on your own.   Talk to a chaplain or health care professional.</item>
        <item>Getting involved in your community and spending time with others can help you feel less alone and allows you to give back to your community.</item>
        <item>Talking about feelings, although uncomfortable, is an important step to getting past grief.</item>
        <item>It’s common for depressed people to believe that nothing will help.  Today\'s treatments for depression are very effective. </item>
        <item>If you\'re depressed avoid the urge to be alone. Be with other people. Confide in someone – it’s healthier than self-isolating. </item>
        <item>Balance your life--don\'t let your day define your priorities, let your priorities define your day.</item>
        <item>If you\'re feeling guilty about something remember that self-forgiveness means recognizing mistakes and accepting shortcomings.</item>
        <item>Don\'t believe everything you think:  Challenge your negative thoughts.  Is there evidence to support the way you are perceiving the situation? </item>
        <item>It\'s not the event that causes stress, it\'s how you interpret the event.  Changing your "all or nothing thinking" will allow you to reduce stress.  </item>
        <item>If staying focused at work is a problem, jotting in a notebook or using a journal can be helpful</item>
        <!-- <item>In some deployed settings it can be tough to schedule times to talk with loved ones .  Make a special effort to contact the family on important dates. </item> -->
        <!-- <item>As you prepare for homecoming after deployment, it’s important to go slow, be patient, and allow several months to reestablish close family connections. </item> -->
        <!-- <item>Lots of reassurance from both parents will help reduce the amount and intensity of children\'s negative reactions to deployment.</item> -->
        <!-- <item>Toddlers will generally copy the attitude of the at-home parent. If the at-home parent is coping well, the child will tend to do well.</item> -->
        <!-- <item>Dealing with deployment issues can be overwhelming.   Talk to family, or friends, or someone from the clergy.</item> -->
        <item>One source of anger is fear.  The next time you get angry, ask yourself what made you afraid.  If you work on the fear, the anger will get better.</item>
        <item>To break the habit of aggressive behavior, it is necessary to become aware of what triggers or sets off the anger.  </item>
        <item>There is a difference between feelings and behavior – an individual may feel angry but the anger does not have to be acted on in an aggressive way. </item>
        <item>There are often feelings behind anger that make the anger stronger like fear which can be based on embarrassment, powerlessness, frustration and hurt.</item>
        <item>Try to avoid words like “should,” “shouldn’t,” “must,” “ought,” “always,” “have to,” or “need to”.  Statements including these words tend to increase anger.  </item>
        <!-- <item>Like physical fitness, spiritual fitness must be tended to and practiced.  Veterans who have a spiritual practice report less severe and fewer PTSD symptoms.</item> -->
        <item>If you are struggling with spiritual question, take the time to talk to someone you trust.</item>
        <item>Participating in activities with family, friends, or a larger community adds  to your spiritual fitness by increasing your connection to other people. </item>
        <item>The ability to make sense of a traumatic event in a way that ‘fits’ with one\'s previous beliefs  may lead to psychological or spiritual growth</item>
        <item>Research shows that when people forgive others, they become less vengeful, and more generous and kind toward others.  </item>
        <!-- <item>Acceptance is part of dealing with an injury.  Depending on the severity of the injury, this process can take between a couple of months and two years.  </item> -->
        <!-- <item>Making sense of your injury may take days, weeks, or months. Give yourself time, but  try to identify how it can have a positive effect on your life. </item> -->
        <item>If you are coping with an injury, remember to set some goals.  Goal-setting is important for both your physical recovery and for positive mental health.</item>
        <!-- <item>Goals while recovering from an injury,  should be challenging enough to keep your interest but not so difficult as to require superhuman effort. </item> -->
        <item>If you are struggling with chronic pain, don\'t give up.  Be open to trying different treatments or combinations of treatments until you find something that works for you. </item>
