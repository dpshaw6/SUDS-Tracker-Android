SUDS Tracker
===============

SUDS Tracker is a mobile application that allows users to self-monitor, track and reference their Subjective Units of DistresS (SUDS) experience over a period of hours, days, weeks and months using a visual analogue rating scale.

Users can self-monitor SUDS experiences associated with common behavioral health issues like borderline personality disorder, eating disorder, substance abuse disorder, post-traumatic stress, brain injury, life stress, depression and anxiety. Additional rating can also be added. With each self-rating, notes on environmental influences on emotional experiences can be added. Self-monitoring results can be a self-help tool or they can be shared with a therapist or health care professional, providing a record of the patient’s emotional experience over a selected time frame.
